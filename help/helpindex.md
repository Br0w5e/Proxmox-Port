## Proxmox Port Source Code
 
You can check out the "Port" branch of this project, which contains the source code for PVE. However, please note that some tool source codes, such as those for Rust, are not included.

The repository directory at the following link is more organized and clear.

https://gitea.lierfang.com/proxmox-port/

I will fork the Proxmox repository and develop in the 'port' branch of my forked repository.

e.g.,https://github.com/jiangcuo/qemu-server/tree/Port

And then regenerate diff and submit to proxmox-port
